# Collective Phase Transitions in Confined Fish Schools
Time-evolution data of behavior described in 2024 PNAS manuscript entitled "Collective phase transitions in confined fish schools" by C. Huang, F. Ling and E. Kanso.

We include swarming, milling, schooling, folling tank wall, and double milling data to this repository. The simulation data is stored as *.mat file which can be loaded directly into MATLAB or python. We downsampled the raw simulation to reduce the file size. 

In each file, there are two variables: position and velocity. Variables are saved as a 3-dimensional matrix using num*2*step.
