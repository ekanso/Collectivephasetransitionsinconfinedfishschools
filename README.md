# Collective Phase Transitions in Confined Fish Schools
Time-evolution data of behavior described in 2024 PNAS manuscript entitled "Collective phase transitions in confined fish schools" by C. Huang, F. Ling and E. Kanso.

We include swarming, milling, schooling, folling tank wall, and doubel milling data to this repository. The simulation data is stored as *.mat file which can be loaded directly by MATLAB or python. We truncate and downsample the raw simulation to reduce the size of file. 

In each file, there are two variables: location and velocity. Each variable are formed by num*2*step 3-dimensional matrix.
